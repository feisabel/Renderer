# Renderer

Computer graphics class project.

## Version 1

In this first version, the renderer accepts a .txt file which specifies a scene (at this point, only a background described by the RGB of its corner pixels) and generates a .ppm file accordingly. 

### Building and running

Run `make`

Run `./renderer data/scene.txt`
